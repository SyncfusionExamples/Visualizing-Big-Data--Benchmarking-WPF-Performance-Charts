# Benchmarking WPF Fast Charts: Unveiling High Performance with 1 Million Data Points

This repository holds a WPF application to benchmark the performance of SfChart's FastLineSeries types when visualizing and interacting with one million data points.

For desktop applications built with WPF, displaying and interacting with this data efficiently is crucial for a smooth user experience. The [SfChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/getting-started) control is engineered for high performance, offering developers the tools to visualize large datasets without compromising on speed or responsiveness. 

## What This Guide Will Help You Achieve?
- **Build High-Performance WPF Charting Applications**: Learn how to configure and optimize WPF SfChart to handle up to 1 million data points with smooth rendering, fast load times, and responsive interactions.

- **Choose the Right Series Types for Your Data**: Explore the differences between fast-series types to select the most efficient rendering strategy for your data visualization needs.
- **Implement a Robust Benchmarking Workflow**: Follow a step-by-step guide to build a benchmarking app that measures key performance metrics from initial load time to interaction latency using real-world scenarios.
- **Scale Confidently with Growing Data Volumes**: Validate that your charting solution can scale gracefully as your data grows, without compromising speed, clarity, or responsiveness.

This benchmarking application offers a detailed look into the performance capabilities of Syncfusion WPF Charts when handling a substantial dataset of one million data points. It highlights how specialized series types are essential for maintaining responsiveness and efficiency in data-intensive applications.
